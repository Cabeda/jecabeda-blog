Recently I've had to help my brother look for apartments in Netherlands. As we are currently living in a house issue where all residences that appeared would be rented in the same day they were published we were feeling that this was going to hard. So I've decided to try Deno and created a scrapper that would look for new houses every 10 seconds on holland2stay. So here's how it went.

## What is Deno?

## Scrapper library

## Adding desktop and email notification

## Compiling into an executable

## Conclusions

With this bit of work, I can say that we were able to detect some houses in seconds. But we weren't interested. It worked flawlessly for a couple of hours and I left the script running on my Macbook through the night. Sadly, even by using amphetamine, it went to sleep and stopped running by 3 A.M. And that was sad because an awesome house appeared in the morning. Our luck was that my brother went to check the website and it arrived at that exact moment!

So, in the end, I failed as the script didn't run when expected but I'll be sure to run it on my Raspberry Pi which doesn't have the same issues. And this is only possible because Deno can compile to Linux.
