![Cyberpunk by DALL-E](./dall_e_cyberpunk.avif)

I've read quite a bit preparing the presentation. Although I'm still writing, rewriting, and doing the demo, I'll start to look for meetups and conferences which might be interesting. Anxious to see how this goes.

**Fun note**: Used DALL-E to generate the image above and then used FFmpeg to go from a 2.3 MB image to 107Kb with minimal loss of quality ðŸ¤”.
