2019 was a good and challenging year. Looking back at the article [I wrote](../20190107-objectives-2019/index.md) it seems I've done more than I hoped (I'm a bit pessimistic at time).

Following the previous year structure I'll divide my review in the following categories:
* Work 
* Entertainment
* Sports
* Travels
* Personal

The travels and personal were in an "Others" category but I find them as important as the others.

### Work
* Found a new place where I can call myself a BI engineer.
* Went to several meetups although I was a regular on any of them
* Wasn't quite able to write with frequency ()

### Entertainment

### Sports

### Travels

### Personal
