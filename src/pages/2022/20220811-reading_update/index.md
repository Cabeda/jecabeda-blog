I've quickly gotten a prototype to generate my reading updates. The python script ([repo](https://git.sr.ht/~jecabeda/pocket)) uses the Pocket API (had to move away from instapaper as they didn't approve a developer key for me to use). It facilitates a lot by listing the articles I've read in markdown. I might be doing some adjustments before publishing it as I might move this to typer cli, avoid recurrent logins and add additional features like cleaning the newsletter articles. Let's see 😅

Another small project I've also built was [Keg](https://keg.cabeda.dev/) ([repo](https://github.com/cabeda/keg)), a simple URL shortener. It has an open API so you can just send a curl POST message to retrieve a shortened link:

```shell
curl --request POST \
  --url https://keg.cabeda.dev/<your URL>
```

I've created as a small funny project to use when generating teams on my [randomizer](https://teamrandomizer.cabeda.dev/). As I wanted to avoid the need for a backend and the URL's were getting big, this was a good solution.

Finnally I've added a single API endpoint to this blog to check how many visitors I have. While writing this I've remembered that it should handle CORS as I just want it to handle calls from the blog 😅
