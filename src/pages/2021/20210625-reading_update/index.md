I've gotten to watch a documentary related to [night watch](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/night-watch-the-missing-pieces) which I found quite nice which explain the image above üòÖ. Related to reading I've gotten started preparing some presentations for conferences, meetups and internal which I hope to use someday... I've also gotten into reading a bit more in airflow as I had to do a migration of airflow which I hope to write more later this week.
