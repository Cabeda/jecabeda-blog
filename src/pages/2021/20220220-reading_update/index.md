## Data Engineering

- [The new modern data stack Airbyte Airflow DBT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l48zwwRSGeA) - For the development of an ELT pipeline, the addition of airbyte to dbt and airflow is really interesting as it finally allows to have a full open source stack. It will be interesting to see how the developers will balance the need to monetize and open source it's core
- [From daily dashboards to enterprise grade data pipelines](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2021/from-daily-dashboards-to-enterprise-grade-data-pipelines) - linkedin tells the history on how they came from a Teradata + microstrategy warehouse to it's current architecture to help answer questions and retrieve insights from their data
- [Building Data Quality into the Enterprise Data Lake](https://medium.com/paypal-tech/building-data-quality-into-the-enterprise-data-lake-9dec305c3757) - paypal writes on how they built a Rule Execution Framework, a platform that provides multiple tools to increase data quality and lineage
- [Announcing ksqlDB 0.23.1](https://www.confluent.io/blog/ksqldb-0-23-1-features-updates/) - This is more of a release note but my interest on streaming SQL has increased with time and I think this will be a game enabler for future data platforms
- [When Postgres blocks: 7 tips for dealing with locks](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2018/02/22/seven-tips-for-dealing-with-postgres-locks/) - Citus Data gives 7 really good tips on some of the most common operations in postgres and should save some headaches
- [Understanding the Metrics Store](https://kyligence.io/blog/understanding-the-metrics-store/) - again with metrics, what we are seeing is a another movement of separating something that was done before on BI tools and accept that we need a centralized way of defining the organization metrics (which can later be used by BI tools )

## Engineering

- [Kubernetes: The Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE77h7dmoQU) - This documentary on kubernetes was really interesting, especially knowing how pervasive the technology is nowadays
- [Include diagrams in your Markdown files with Mermaid](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) - As a github user this new feature is really great as we can start to define our architecture changes in diagrams directly on each repo and open discussions on it
- [A non-exhaustive list of my favorite things about working at companies with a culture of writing](https://founder-fodder.ghost.io/writing-cultures-win/) - Not quite a technical article but writing is a really good skill that enables clearer understading inside a company and can be an enabler of new initiatives and open good career paths

## Others

- [Imitate, then Innovate](https://perell.com/essay/imitate-then-innovate/) - This isn't a technical article but it resonates with my experience where I struggle first to learn and immitating help bring oneself to the next step and innovate on any given field
