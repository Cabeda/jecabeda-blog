Hi there! I've gathered some articles and in the meanwhile I've been reading a bit about scala and also saving some papers for a "ligh read".

## Architectures

The topics are over reaching but in the data systems distributed systems is a must.

- [The Pros and Cons of DRY Code](https://qvault.io/2021/01/25/the-pros-and-cons-of-dry-code/)
- [The Evolution of Precomputation Technology and its Role in Data Analytics](https://www.infoq.com/articles/evolution-precomputation-technology-data-analytics/)
- [Patterns of Distributed **Systems**](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems)

## Python

A new proposal around python dependencies in [Introducing PDM](https://frostming.com/2021/01-22/introducing-pdm/). Another good one is poetry with some advantages presented on [A poetic apology](https://muttdata.ai/blog/2020/08/21/a-poetic-apology.html)

## Streaming

Kafka is one of those critical systems which has grown so much that we are having discussions like [Kafka As A Database? Yes Or No](https://davidxiang.com/2021/01/10/kafka-as-a-database/). I've liked this overview of both sides and, although I actually need to read the book Kafka: the definitive guide this presentation [Kafka as a Platform: The Ecosystem from the Ground Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy6jNKI3tKU) by Robin Moffatt has given me a pretty great bird eye view.

## Databases

I'm always on the lookout for new databases like scylladb (although I keep using the trusty postgresql) and for those that keep using select * the second article might be a good reason to avoid it. 

- [MongoDB vs Scylla at Numberly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch1vRQBiXtI&feature=emb_logo)
- [https://tanelpoder.com/posts/reasons-why-select-star-is-bad-for-sql-performance/](https://tanelpoder.com/posts/reasons-why-select-star-is-bad-for-sql-performance/)

## Orchestration

Coming back to airflow, Cloudfare as shown how truly great this technology can be for all kinds of needs in [Automating data center expansions with Airflow](https://blog.cloudflare.com/automating-data-center-expansions-with-airflow/)

## Organization

In the tech environment I'm working I've actually felt the consequences of the different types of companies shown in [What Silicon Valley "Gets" about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers)

More related to data teams I can concur with the views in [How to Drive Effective Data Science Communication with Cross-Functional Teams](https://doordash.engineering/2021/02/11/how-to-drive-effective-data-science-communication/) that shows how importan is the communication of insights which is often overlooked.

Be well and stay safe :-)
