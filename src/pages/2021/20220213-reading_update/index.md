## Data Engineering

- [What I learned from the open source data stack conference 2021](https://jameskle.com/writes/open-source-data-stack-2021) - A good recap on coalesce conference
- [7 Must-know Data Buzzwords](https://kyligence.io/blog/7-must-know-data-buzzwords/) - I know buzzwords can be something that goes as fast as it comes but I truly believe some of these are too stay (data mesh, metric store fo example)
- [Iteratively Blog - Who should really own your tracking plan?](https://iterative.ly/blog/tracking-plan-ownership) - This isn't very technical but it's really important to know how to organize the products to make it possible to extract insights and data products ASAP
- [Spark on Kubernetes in 2022](https://medium.com/@vladimir.prus/spark-on-kubernetes-in-2022-32458999e831) - As someone using AWS EMR for running Spark jobs, the usage of Kubernetes is quite a fresh of air and Joom makes clear the pros and cons of this approach
- [Lightweight technology governance](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/articles/lightweight-technology-governance) - This article can be a bit heavy but brings some good points on how automation and not locking the teams to a specific organization but give them enough advantages that they follow a common practice are great values I'd say any company should strive for
- [Cost Efficiency @ Scale in Big Data File Format](https://eng.uber.com/cost-efficiency-big-data/) - Uber writes a great article on how a change of compaction method can lead to great down costs (in this case using ZTSD)

## Engineering

- [The Biggest Mistake I See Engineers Make](https://www.thezbook.com/the-biggest-mistake-i-see-engineers-make-2/) - this article comes close to the heart as I tend to make these mistakes. Sure is a good reminder to go through fast iterations instead of falling into waterfall
