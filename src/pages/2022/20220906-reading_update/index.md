I've taken some time to study and add notes to my [second brain](http://strange.cabeda.dev/). It has been an interesting way of studying which has left me with a thought. Could I measure my productivity by written words? The days I write more seem to be the most productive ones. But could I even measure the difference of words day by day? This could be something interesting to do.
