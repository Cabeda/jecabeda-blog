This week I've gotten to read a lot on architecture. I'm still trying to reduce the articles on my pile and hopefully start an article of my own before my book of scala arrives.

## Analysis

I can't recommend enough Our world in data, a source of multiple insights on how we are faring globally. This website has been heavily used for the book Enlighment now and I've gotten around to read [Global poverty in an unequal world](https://ourworldindata.org/higher-poverty-global-line) which presents a deep dive into how we measure poverty and how we could improve it.

## SQL

I've been working with trino (former prestosql) for the last two years and I really like where it's going with the increase of more connectors, the increase in performance and the constant add of SQL features like the one in [Introducing new window features](https://trino.io/blog/2021/03/10/introducing-new-window-features.html). Let's hope the community around this keeps growing!

## Work

I've subscribed to Increment, a magazine published by stripe which usually deep dives into themes which sometimes are new to me (they've introduced the on-call tom me). For the last edition I've related a lot to [Your brain on progress](https://increment.com/reliability/accomplishment-culture/) where Lara Hogan looks into how to manage big tasks.

## Architecture

Somehow I've read a lot on how we should be developing our data systems, be it for scaling, investment on open-source  or best practices. I leave below some of the most interesting (in my opinion of course):

- [Scaling Reporting at Reddit](https://redditblog.com/2021/02/26/scaling-reporting-at-reddit/)
- [the Furure of Business Inteligence is Open Source](https://maximebeauchemin.medium.com/the-future-of-business-intelligence-is-open-source-9b654595773a)
- [DAG Writin Best Practices in Apache Airflow](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/dag-writing-best-practices-in-apache-airflow)
- [The New Rules of Data Quality](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-new-rules-of-data-quality-5e4fdecb9618)
- [Evolving Schemaless into a Distributed SQL Database ](https://eng.uber.com/schemaless-sql-database/)


Stay safe and have a nice week!
