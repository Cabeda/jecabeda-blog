- [Integrated Audits: Streamlined Data Observability with Apache Iceberg](https://tabular.io/blog/integrated-audits/) - Apache Iceberg is a great tool and the time travel feature, as shown in this article, presents a great way to create a "branch" test the changes and then apply them
- [Data diffs: Algorithms for explaining what changed in a dataset](https://blog.marcua.net/2022/02/20/data-diffs-algorithms-for-explaining-what-changed-in-a-dataset.html) - This is a proposal to add a diff operator to SQL which, after reading this article would be an incredible addition
- [Practical Schema Evolution with Avro](https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/practical-schema-evolution-with-avro-c07af8ba1725) - Useful guide from Elliot West with the different compatibilities of Avro and the type of schema change that can be done
