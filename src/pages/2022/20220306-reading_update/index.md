## Data Engineering

- [An Introduction to Modern Data Lake Storage Layers](https://dacort.dev/posts/modern-data-lake-storage-layers/) - A good comparison, using apache spark on how to create and run some operations on tables using Hudi, Iceberg and deltalake
- [Apache Spark Performance Boosting](https://towardsdatascience.com/apache-spark-performance-boosting-e072a3ec1179) - A very good article on the main performance issues we can get on apache Spark. As a relative beginner this might be a good go-to resource for me
- [Plumbing with Airbyte](https://www.topofthelyne.co/p/plumbing-with-airbyte) - Airbyte is becoming a really good replacement for Fivetran and I'm keeping close tabs on it
- [Rebundling the Data Platform](https://dagster.io/blog/rebundling-the-data-platform) - Dagster shows a very interesting take of asset based dags instead of the traditional tasks
