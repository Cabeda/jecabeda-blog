This week I've had to focus more on my debugging skills with Node + typescript. Currently doing lots of backend development and it's requiring some non-trivial adjustments. Nonetheless, I need to finish work on the rust book so that I can try and implement the genome project. Classic 1, 2 and I keep getting other things to do and finishing none. And one new project that came is to do a 10 KM run in my home city. Not tech related but I might pick the run data from my training runs to do some analysis. But again, I have two side projects to finish and then I'll check this. Either that or I do the typical 2 hours of work and see what comes of it.
